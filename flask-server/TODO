What is this?
Secure Message Board project
This is a very simple but secure message board system.

What have you consider?

- You can use any password. The only requiremens is that it should be at least 8 chars long. Spaces, phrases are accepted
- Email of the user must be confirmed before using the system
- It's mandatory to used two factor authentication
- The password is hashed before inserting it in DB


How do I use it
You can follow the below steps but if you want something easier use it online at:
http://coursera.acostasite.com:8000/

If you want to go further, just download the VM at:
http://stats.labs.lacnic.net/COURSERA/capstone-vm

If you want to install:

Requirements:
- Flask
- Python3
- MySQL
- MTA (Email Server) (in my case using Postfix in the same server)

1) Create the DB
mysql -u root -p -e "create database COURSERA"; 
mysql -u username -p -h localhost COURSERA < schema.sql

Running:
Just type: python3 index.php


TODO
- Secondfactor auth could be just a code, not a link. Maybe to have both options
- Link for confirmation could be just a code, not a link. Maybe both options
- Change password (however you can say: lost password)
- Some mechanishm like garbage collector should exists for cleaning the DB (when user is not confirmed and so on)
- Encrypt the full DB?
